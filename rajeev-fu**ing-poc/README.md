# Micro Frontend POC

Micro service architecture for frontends.

#Pros:
1. Full UI app can be separated in Individual Micro frontends.
2. Different teams can work on different ui apps.
3. No dependency on other teams, teams can ship code independently.
4. Technology agnostic, different tech can be used for different UIs.

#Cons:
1. No predefined architecture is there yet, still a new topic in 2020. Everyone is doing it differently.
2. Good if we have a very big and complex UI, otherwise we are just doing more work in setting up of the micro-frontend architecture and implementing it, instead of the real app.
3. Can be slow during the initial loading of the app.
